        <h2>Why are they "dangerous"?</h2>
        <p>Due to their mass and stregnth, pitbuklls are often used in dog fighting. That doesnt mean that they're all
            monsters though.</p>

        <h3>They're really just little derpy goofballs.</h3>
        <p>Some of the silliest dogs I have ever encountered have been big ol derpy pitbulls with tons of personality.
        </p>

        <h4>Big ol lovers.</h4>
        <p>Nothing but cuddlebugs. that is all they truly are.</p>
